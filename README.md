# CS50
My website created

I created this website using the skill that I have gained throughout this cs50 course and the cs50 programming for the web course. This is the first website that I have ever built and I think it looks pretty good. I decided to create this website to solve a big problem in my local community in which people are not very unfit, and suffer from obesity and a lack of motivation to work due to laziness. I would like to help people by getting them outside of their houses to do some exercise and do other fun activities such as skydiving or ziplining to get them out of their comfort zones. All the source code will be available on my github here:https://github.com/QoSz/CS50
